# C Programming:
C is a powerful and widely used general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie in the early 1970s at Bell Labs. Known for its efficiency and portability, C has become the foundation for numerous operating systems, software applications, and embedded systems. It is a procedural language, following a structured approach to programming. Its syntax is minimalistic yet expressive, providing low-level control over the hardware while maintaining a relatively simple and elegant design. C's popularity stems from its ability to directly interact with the computer's memory, making it suitable for system-level programming tasks and optimizing performance-critical applications. 
Its standard library offers a rich set of functions to manipulate strings, arrays, and other data structures efficiently. As a widely taught programming language, C serves as an excellent starting point for learning computer programming concepts and understanding the underlying principles of how computers work. Despite its age, C remains relevant and widely used in various domains, such as operating systems, compilers, embedded systems, and game development, making it a fundamental language for programmers to master.

# Java Programming
Java is a general-purpose high-level programming language. It means using Java we can develop verities of applications like desktop applications web applications enterprise application device applications. Java is a technology because Java has huge library support for simplifying the code complexity due to support or readymade method. The extension of Java is (.java). java is a platform. A platform is an environment where we can execute our Java program. java has its own JRE thatâ€™s why can say Java is itself a platform.
JAVA is compiled as well as an interpreted language. Java supports object-oriented programming. Java is used to develop an internet base of applications [applet, servlet, JSP]. Java is used to create dynamic web pages. Java provides facilities to program electronic consumable devices such as mobile, laptops, and palmtops, using J2ME. Java supports multithreading.
Java Standard Edition(JSE) provides the basic core functionality of the Java programming language. The core Java concept is called JSE which is especially used to develop a standalone application or desktop application. Java Enterprise Edition(JEE) is especially used to develop web and enterprise applications. On enterprise platforms, JEE is widely used for developing enterprise-level applications. Java Micro Edition(JME) is used to develop mobile device applications or we can say that Android development is the JME of Java language.
Java Development Kit(JDK) provides an environment to develop and run a Java application. So we have to install JDK first. Java Runtime Environment(JRE) provides an environment only to run a Java application. Once you install the JDK automatically JRE will create. Java Virtual Machine(JVM) is an interpreter who is responsible to run a Java program one statement at a time. JVM provides a Java execution engine that executes the Java source code.
